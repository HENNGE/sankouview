# sankouview
A simple Kotlin based viewer for displaying Open Source Software (OSS) license data for Android. The purpose of this tool is a drop-in replacement for previous (now deprecated) license listing tools.

# Design
Currently this tool relies on he [licensee library](https://github.com/cashapp/licensee) for parsing data. 
This library depends on output from the licensee library and provides multiple ways to display the contents based on app needs:
- As a stand alone activity
- (TODO: Fill in other modes here after they are verified tested)

# Including This Project
(TODO)

# Usage
### Call as an activity
